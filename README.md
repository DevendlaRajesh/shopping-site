# Rajesh â€” Full Stack Developer (Homepage)

This is a simple static homepage for Rajesh. It includes a responsive layout, hero section, services, selected projects, and a contact form (client-side only).

## How to view locally

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser. On macOS you can double click the file or run:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

2. For a simple local server (recommended), run one of the following from this folder:

   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # then open http://localhost:8000
   ```

## Notes

- The contact form is mocked with a client-side handler. Replace the send logic with a backend endpoint or mailto if you want real messages.
- Replace `rajesh@example.com` in the contact card with your real email.
